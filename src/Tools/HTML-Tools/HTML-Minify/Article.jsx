                HTML minification is the process of removing unnecessary
                characters from HTML code, such as whitespace, line breaks,
                comments and unnecessary tags. This compression reduces the file
                size, making websites load faster and improving user experience.
                The process involves analyzing the HTML code, identifying
                redundant elements and removing them without compromising the
                website's functionality.

                The benefits of HTML minification are numerous. Faster page
                loads enhance visitor engagement, while improved SEO boosts
                search engine rankings. Reduced bandwidth usage lowers hosting
                costs, and better mobile performance ensures a smooth user
                experience across devices. Additionally, faster-loading websites
                have higher conversion rates, contributing to improved business
                outcomes.
